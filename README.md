Traninig ResNet34 on the CIFAR-10 dataset and plotted the number of steps and the SFO complexities of SGD using the Armijo condition where 
$\bar \alpha$ is small. Please see [number of steps](./CIFAR10_max_alpha_K-b.png) and [number of SFO](./CIFAR10_max_alpha_Kb-b.png) for details.

Training ResNet34 on the CIFAR-10 dataset and plotted the number of steps and the SFO complexities of SGD using the Armijo condition needed for the test accuracy to be more than 0.90. Please see [number of steps](./CIFAR10_test_K-b.png) and [number of SFO](./CIFAR10_test_Kb-b.png) for details.

Training ResNet34 on the CIFAR-10 dataset and plotted the number of steps and the SFO complexities of SGD using the Armijo condition needed for the training loss to be more than 0.001. Please see [number of steps](./CIFAR10_loss_K-b.png) and [number of SFO](./CIFAR10_loss_Kb-b.png)  for details.
